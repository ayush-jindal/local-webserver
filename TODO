1) on clicking expand multiple times, multiple requests sent and processed
(done) 2) collapse the expanded dir
3) should i hide the rows on collapsing or create a new request each time
    with the second method, file list always upto date
    might also be possible to alternate between request and hide after certain
        time interval
4) upload request for multiple files and also creating folders
5) maybe child chaining in classlist happening if same dir opened multiple times
